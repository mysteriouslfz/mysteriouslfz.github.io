Easy Abstract
======
We propose a Continuous Neighbors Aggregation method named CoNA that models the continuous dynamics of discrete-time embeddings with neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE).We further propose a parallel Euler method with adaptive step size to solve the ODEs in CoNA efficiently.
